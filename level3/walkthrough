#so we see a binary who execute a shell conditionnaly of the value of a m variable
#the m variable is not defined in the v function, so it must be a global variable
=> we must find and replace this var with the value 0x40

#with gdb we see that the address of m is 0x804988c
x 0x804988c => m is equal to 0, we must change it
	\x8c\x98\x04\x08


#the problem is the program use fgets and not gets anymore
the address of char *format, the string where is stocked the imput is 0xbffff520

#nevermind, we can open the shell directly with gdb by changing the value of eax to 0x40
=>but we are still the user level3, we are not level4! (why?)

# with python -c "print 'A'*525" | ~/level3
we see that the max number of char returned is 511 A  + '\0'

=> We can't exploit fgets, so let's exploit printf who use directly our string

#https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/23985
# we see that our string starts with an offset of 4 bytes in our stack
python -c "print 'A'*4 + ' %4\$x'" | ./level3
> AAAA 41414141

#we need to modify m with a value of 60
#we know the address of m
#the printf of %nb\$p with nb a number told us we are at 4 of the start of the string of printf
#so if we put \x8c\x98\x04\x08%4$n
#we write 4 in m
#so we just need to put 64 in m and it is won

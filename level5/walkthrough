The goal here was to replace the call of exit in the n fonction by a call to the o function.

As we learned how to use the printf function to write into specific memory address, we just had to find in wich we had to write.
We firstly found that our buffer offset was 4

Then we used Cutter to find the adress of exit wich is 0x08049838
We replaced it''s value by o function''s address wich is 0x080484a4

And then  just had to keep the pipe open and Voil√† !
